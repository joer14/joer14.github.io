        <p>
          I enjoy working in small high impact teams and delivering quality
          technical solutions. Working in small teams has been instrumental in
          allowing me to develop my skills as a generalist. As such I’ve been
          privileged to work on wide variety of projects, from interactive data
          visualizations on the frontend to authentication and authorization on
          the backend. I’ve also worked on predictive analytics, data pipelines,
          EHR integrations and DevOps. In addition to my work as an individual 
          contributor, I also enjoy supporting others in a leadership and 
          management capacity and growing teams.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please feel free to contact me if you think I might be a good fit for
          your organization. I'll be transparent about what I know and what I
          don't know.
        </p>
